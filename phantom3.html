A complete 4K camera and 3-axis gimbal system come integrated with the Phantom 3 Professional edition quadcopter from DJI. In addition to video, the camera is capable shooting up to 12 MP still photos using JPEG or non-proprietary DNG RAW format. The three axes of the gimbal give you pan and tilt control, and keep the horizon line level even as the aircraft banks. Different gimbal settings allow the camera to lock onto a fixed subject, be moved manually using transmitter rotaries or the app, or to simply provide camera stabilization.

This bundle of the Phantom 3 is classed as "ready-to-fly." This means the basics to get you in the air are included - a flight battery, charger, and pre-bound handheld transmitter (radio controller), and 16GB microSD card among them. Depending on your application, you may also require additional memory cards, additional flight batteries, and a mobile device to access the app, and possibly other accessories. Also note that a number of important compass and GPS calibration steps must be carried out before flying to ensure the flight control computer operates correctly. Please refer to the manual or Quick Start Guide before your first flight.
<h2>Phantom 3 Flight Control System</h2>

<h3>Main Controller</h3>
    The burden of processing and analyzing flight data in real time it taken up by the Main Controller, the brains of the computerized flight control system. It collects data from the entire system, including motor speed, GPS location, your command inputs, and data from automatic sensors, and analyzes it all to tell your Phantom 3 exactly how to behave at any given moment 

<h3>GPS Navigation</h3>
    Because of the complexity associated with multi-rotor aircraft the Phantom 3 relies on a GPS-based navigation system to maintain flight stability and provide other features. While fully manual operation is possible, most users, especially videographers hoping to get the smoothest possible shoots, will opt for one of the GPS-assisted modes 

<h3>IMU</h3>
    The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) uses a 6-axis gyroscope plus an accelerometer to keep track the slightest tilt or change in acceleration. This data is relayed to the Main Controller and used to help maintain a stable flight 

<h3>ESCs</h3>
    Four Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) not only relay vital motor speed information to the Main Controller, they also send commands back to the motors based on your input. This constant communication helps keeps your Phantom 3 stable in flight, and also helps you achieve any flight movement, from gentle pans to rapid acceleration 

<h3>Vision Positioning System for Indoor Navigation</h3>
    Vision Positioning System uses a specially designed camera as well as sonic waves to provide comparable stability function indoors or close to the ground as GPS does outdoors. This technology allows the Phantom 3 to hold its location, stop when the controls are released, and quickly respond to pilot commands even when GPS is unavailable 

<h3>Auto-Takeoff</h3>
    With one tap in the DJI Pilot app, the Phantom 3 will turn on its motors and raise to a pre-set height. It will then hover in place, completely motionless until you direct it where to go 

<h3>Auto-Landing</h3>
    When GPS is available, the Phantom 3 remembers the exact spot that it took off from. Simply tap a button to have it return to the point from which it took off 

<h3>Return to Home Failsafe</h3>
    If the Quadcopter loses the signal from the controller for any reason or the battery starts to run low the "return to home" feature will initialize. The aircraft will ascend to 60 feet then make a straight-line course back to the "home position" you will have defined during the GPS calibration process. Once there, it will safely descend to the ground and power itself off 

<h3>Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC)</h3>
    IOC is designed to help make flying more intuitive. Nominally, the yaw control will allow the Quadcopter to rotate continuously, which can quickly become confusing if you lose track of which way is "front". Suddenly your controls can get mixed up, where pressing right causes the craft to move left and pressing forward causes it move backward. Intelligent Orientation Control prevents this from happening, keeping the "tail" of the Quadcopter pointed roughly toward the pilot at all times 

<h3>Waypoints</h3>
    Use the ground station software provided by the app to layout autopilot courses based on waypoints 

<h3>Follow Me</h3>
    With Follow Me, the aircraft will automatically follow you and capture your every move from a unique aerial perspective 

<h3>Course Lock</h3>
    By activating Course Lock, the controls will be set to be relative to your aircraft's current path. This easy navigation allows you to fly in a set direction as you fly alongside moving objects or across scenes 

<h3>Home Lock</h3>
    Fix your controls to be relative to the Home Point. Easily pull back on the control stick to bring the aircraft back home, or push forward to fly farther away, no matter which way it is facing 

<h2>On-Board 4K Camera</h2>

<h3>Up to 4K Video and 12MP Stills</h3>
    The included camera system features video recording at up to 4K30 (4096 x 2160) in H.264 and also takes JPEG and DNG RAW photos at 12MP. The camera mounts via an integrated 3-axis gimbal that provides stabilization as well as pan and tilt control. Media is recorded internally to a microSD card 

<h3>Video Resolutions and Frame Rates</h3>
    <b>DCI 4K (4096 x 2160)</b>: 24p, 25p<br>
    <b>UHD 4K (3840 x 2160)</b>: 24p, 25p, 30p<br>
    <b>1080p (1920 x 1080)</b>: 24p, 25p, 30p, 48p, 50p, 60p<br>
    <b>720p (1280 x 720)</b>: 24p, 25p, 30p, 48p, 50p, 60p <br>

<h3>94° Wide Angle Lens</h3>
    The camera features a 94° angle-of-view lens, which is a narrower angle than a fisheye for less distortion while still being wide enough to enable capturing establishing shots. The lens features an f/2.8 aperture and is comprised of 9 elements, including an aspherical element 

<h3>Integrated 3-Axis Gimbal</h3>
    The gimbal provides stability by counteracting unwanted motion such as wind buffeting or vibration and also keeps the horizon level even as the quadcopter banks. Control dials on the transmitter (radio controller) allow you to manually pan and tilt the camera 

<h2>DJI GO App for iOS and Android</h2>

<h3>Camera Control and Live 720p Monitoring</h3>
    View a live 720p HD image with the free Pilot mobile for Android or iOS mobile device.
