	<p>With the ability to capture 4K at 30 fps (4K30), the <b>GoPro HERO4 Black</b> allows you to move beyond HD when recording POV style footage either wearing the camera or mounting it in a number of creative ways. On top of 4K, the camera shoots 2.7K at up to 60 fps, Full HD (1080p) at up to 120 fps for high definition slow motion, WVGA (848 x 480) for upload-friendly files, and more. Plus, with the SuperView mode enabled, the camera maximizes its sensor area to give you an ultra-wide angle of view to enhance the POV feel of footage while encompassing as much of the scene as possible. The HERO4 Black's capabilities don't end with video, though. It can take 12-megapixel stills as individual shots, in intervals for stitching together time-lapse movies, or in momentary bursts of up to 30 photos per second - the latter helping ensure you catch fast action at just the right moment.

For remote monitoring and operation, the camera is equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, letting you pair it with a mobile device or the separately available Smart Remote. There is also a USB port for file transfer, charging, or to connect the optional 3.5mm mic adapter. Further promoting its take-anywhere claim, the 131' Standard Housing is included, and not only keeps the camera dry, it adds an extra layer of protection. In addition to the bundled flat and adhesive mounts, the camera is also adaptable to a wide range of separately available mounts from GoPro and third-parties - with options to accommodate just about any scenario imaginable.

2x Faster Processor than HERO3+ Black Edition</h3>
    The redesigned processor is twice as fast as the one in the HERO3+ Black Edition. This enables 4K30 recording as well as 2.7K recording at up to 60 fps, 1080p slow-motion recording at 120 fps, and 720p slow-motion at 240 fps

    Note: Please ensure your camera is updated to the latest firmware to take advantage of all of these frame rates 

<h3>Built-In Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</h3>
    Allows you to pair the HERO4 with a mobile device running the GoPro App, or use the separately available Smart Remote. With the app you can preview, playback, and share your favorite shots via email, text, Facebook, Instagram, and more. With the Smart Remote, it is possible to control of up to 50 cameras from distances of up to 600' line-of-sight. The advantage of using Bluetooth instead of Wi-Fi - where supported - is reduced power consumption 

<h3>GoPro App and Studio Software</h3>
    Expand your GoPro experience with the free GoPro App and GoPro Studio software. The GoPro App allows you to control your camera remotely using your phone or tablet, view and share your content, and watch "best of" videos on the GoPro Channel. Use GoPro Studio to create your own engaging GoPro-style videos to share with the world 

<h3>Up to 12-Megapixel Photos</h3>
    While in the 12-megapixel photo mode it is possible to record a high-speed burst at up 30 fps, helping you capture action stills at just the right moment. The following photo settings are available:

        <li>12MP (Default): Wide; 4000 x 3000</li>
        <li>7MP: Wide, Medium; 3000 x 2250</li>

    Note: Please ensure you are updated to the latest firmware to use this feature 

<h3>Night Photo and Night Lapse</h3>
    Take photos at user-defined intervals to use in time-lapse videos. It is also possible to set an exposure time of up to 30 seconds per shot - whether in time-lapse or single shot - which is ideal for outdoor nighttime work. The following Night Lapse interval settings are available:

Just press the dedicated button on the camera or Smart Remote, or use the GoPro App to tag your highlights 

<h3>QuikCapture</h3>
    This mode turns the GoPro into a one-button camera, allowing you to power on and start recording automatically with the press of a single button. Press once to record video, press and hold for two seconds to capture Time Lapse photos 

<h3>Selectable FOV</h3>
    Three field of view settings are offered: Ultra Wide, Medium, and Narrow. These help you choose the preferred perspective, be it wide-angle and inclusive, medium for a bit of focus, or close-up 

<h3>Audio Acquisition</h3>
    There is an internal mono mic and it is possible to record from an external source using a separately available 3.5mm mic adapter. An integrated ADC (analog-to-digital converter) in the HERO4 Black enables compatibility with a wider variety of professional, low-sensitivity external mics for immersive stereo audio capture and enhanced performance - whether recording voices, an acoustic jam session, or a live show
